Michigan;In general, the State of Michigan requires permits to carry firearms, but these are typically obtained through straightforward and brief processes. Regarding school zones, carrying weapons is completely prohibited, and expulsion is enforced if a student is caught with a firearm on school grounds. The 2018 peak can be explained by collective paranoia following the 2018 Parkland, Florida shooting, which led to an increase in reports that year. Afterwards, Michigan maintains a fairly constant trend until the Oxford High School massacre in 2021, which led to strengthened state laws and an increase in reports.
Minnesota;Minnesota generally experiences isolated incidents. Its firearm regulations include mandatory permits for both concealed and open carry, as well as disciplinary measures for students caught with a weapon on school property (not necessarily expulsion). However, a considerable rise is seen in 2021, which cannot be attributed to a specific event but rather to behavioral effects from the pandemic and the return to normal life with its accompanying restrictions.
Mississippi;Before 2016, Mississippi required a permit to carry firearms. This restriction led to higher reporting rates. However, in 2016 the requirement was removed, and since then no permit is needed, resulting in fewer reports since it's no longer regulated. Since 2021, with the return to in-person schooling, incidents have increased due to behavioral changes following lockdowns and pandemic restrictions. Additionally, Mississippi is a red (conservative) state, meaning it tends to support free gun carrying as part of the Second Amendment.
Missouri;Missouri has no notable policies or political trends that explain its low rate of students carrying firearms. Restrictions on carrying guns were removed in 2016, and firearms can be freely purchased in most districts. Overall, there are no significant increases or decreases over the years, maintaining a consistently low level.
Montana;Montana is a rural state sustained by agriculture and livestock. It is also heavily influenced by politics, being strongly Republican, aligning with the general conservative view of local society. Firearms are part of daily life through sports or regular activities, so most households have guns. This culture is reflected in the consistently high rates. In 2021, after the return to in-person classes, incidents increased again.
Nebraska;Nebraska is a rural and conservative state, where gun ownership is part of the culture, indirectly giving students access. Additionally, it has a small student population, so isolated events weigh more heavily in statistics relative to population size. There is no major information about incidents that could explain rises or drops in the analyzed period.
Nevada;Nevada has regulations regarding gun ownership, specifically requiring state-issued permits for public carry, although such permits are easy to obtain if minimum age requirements are met. There is no information on local incidents to explain rises and drops over time. The increase in 2021 is due to the return to in-person schooling after the pandemic.
New Hampshire;A small state in the northeastern U.S., New Hampshire lacks a strong political trend or gun culture. However, firearm acquisition is lightly regulated, and concealed carry faces few restrictions. The rises in 2013 and 2017 may be due to isolated incidents that appear statistically significant due to the small population. There is no further information influencing this aspect.
New Jersey;New Jersey is an urban, densely populated state with a low gun culture, reflected in consistent regulations on both use and acquisition. These factors result in a low, stable rate over time, without significant fluctuations.
New Mexico;New Mexico has a strong gun culture in rural areas, although there are restrictions requiring permits to carry firearms. Between 2011 and 2014, there was a significant drop in crime rates, possibly explaining a decrease during that period. However, since 2014, several shootings occurred (e.g., Berrendo Middle School, 2014; Aztec High School, 2016), possibly leading to a general rise in reports. The drop in 2020 is attributed to the pandemic, while the subsequent rise after returning to in-person classes may be linked to students' mental health after confinement and the ease of obtaining weapons.
New York;New York has strict regulations on acquiring and carrying firearms. Since the NY SAFE Act (2013), gun use has been heavily regulated, and new government initiatives have improved school safety (e.g., installing cameras). Additionally, NY has a dedicated school safety force, the NYPD School Safety Division. These factors explain the state's overall low rates. The small peak in 2017–2018 could be due to nationwide shootings like Parkland (2018), which raised awareness and detection.
Ohio;Ohio imposes restrictions on firearm use, though obtaining carry permits is not difficult. Small increases are linked to national events like the Sandy Hook massacre (2012) and the implementation of the national FASTER program (Faculty/Administrator Safety Training & Emergency Response) between 2014 and 2017, which exposed students more to firearms. The 2021 rise can be explained by population-wide mental health issues due to pandemic restrictions and confinement.
Oklahoma;Rates in Oklahoma remain within a consistent range, likely due to mild but existing restrictions. The state is strongly pro-gun, with most households owning at least one firearm. There are no remarkable events during this period that influenced this issue.
Oregon;In 2013, Oregon banned carrying loaded firearms in public, following a Portland-led initiative from 2010. In 2015, background checks were expanded for firearm purchases. These measures were driven by growing divisions over gun regulation. Since 2020, private gun purchases have increased, and combined with the pandemic, this likely explains the 2021 rise.
Pennsylvania;Pennsylvania allows concealed carry with a license (easy to obtain) and requires background checks for any firearm purchase. The state's rates have remained relatively low. Incidents like Sandy Hook and Parkland encouraged calls for more regulation, but these proposals did not pass in Pennsylvania.
Rhode Island;Rhode Island is the smallest U.S. state, so isolated cases have a strong impact on statistics. It enforces strict regulations such as background checks, mandatory permits for concealed weapons, bans on large firearms, and rifle restrictions. There are no notable legislative or social events explaining peaks or drops during the analyzed timeframe.
Tennessee;Tennessee requires permits for concealed carry. There are no major state-level events explaining rate changes. However, it's possible that after attacks such as the 2015 Chattanooga shooting, regulations became stricter, increasing detection of firearms in schools. Rates dropped significantly during the pandemic (2020) and rose again after in-person classes resumed, likely due to mental health issues caused by confinement.
Texas;Texas is one of the most permissive states regarding firearm use and acquisition. Given its predominantly Republican stance, regulations are relatively lax. A key event was the 2018 Santa Fe High School shooting, which killed ten people. Despite this, local gun laws were not tightened, and the effect on rates that year was minimal. Its generally low rates may also be due to its large student population, which dilutes isolated incidents statistically, and its strong gun culture that normalizes firearm presence.
Utah;A predominantly Mormon and Republican state with a strong gun culture. Fluctuations in rates may result from inconsistent data rather than state-specific trends. Notably high rates in 2013 and 2018 could be linked to policies allowing school staff to carry guns since 2004 and several student firearm incidents (e.g., West High School, 2018). In 2021, following the permitless carry law, Salt Lake City police reported record gun confiscations from youth (SLCPD Annual Report 2021).
Vermont;Vermont allows gun carry without a license but restricts purchases through background checks and raised the minimum buying age to 21. Firearms are banned on school property. Rate increases may be explained by the small state size, where isolated incidents significantly affect statistics.
Virginia;Virginia requires a permit for concealed carry, though it's easy to obtain. Rates remain stable over time despite multiple mass shootings, such as Virginia Beach in 2019. The effects of such events may have been delayed by the pandemic, leading to higher firearm detections in 2021 upon returning to in-person learning.
West Virginia;Like other states, West Virginia required a concealed carry permit until 2016, when the restriction was revoked. The state's strong gun culture is reflected in high household gun ownership. The 2013–2016 increase, however, has another explanation: in 2013, the state changed how information was collected for the NCES, causing reported numbers to spike during that period and drop afterward (WVDE, 2015).
Washington;Washington enforces stricter regulations for firearm possession and acquisition, meaning permits are harder to obtain. Several school shootings have occurred, including the Marysville Pilchuck High School shooting (2014). Overall, rates have remained relatively stable without notable increases or decreases.
Wisconsin;Gun-carrying laws are relatively permissive in Wisconsin, though firearms are completely banned in school zones except for certain staff exceptions. There is also a requirement to report any firearm possession on school grounds. There's no clear legislative or incident-based explanation for fluctuations in rates during the analyzed period.
Wyoming;Wyoming is a small state, so isolated cases heavily impact rates. Between 2015 and 2016, it implemented a new security system (K-12 School Security Remedy Guide), which may have increased reported cases since gun ownership laws are very relaxed (concealed carry without a permit allowed since 2011). Wyoming is also strongly pro-gun, with most households owning firearms, making students more familiar with and susceptible to using them.
