Year;Context
2011;Gun violence in schools intensified compared to the previous decade, with early talk about arming staff and improving campus security. Although systematic tracking of mishandled guns hadn’t begun, several deadly attacks revealed the danger of firearm access on campus. Five major shootings left 10 dead and 7 injured (e.g., Millard South High School, Virginia Tech).
2012;The deadliest school-shooting year of the decade saw the Sandy Hook Elementary tragedy (26 victims) and several others, totaling 41 deaths and 8 injuries. The aftermath reignited national debates on gun reform, student safety, and the growing risk of mishandled firearms in educational settings.
2013;Campus and K-12 shootings continued, heightening fear and sparking controversy over arming teachers. Experts warned that more guns in classrooms would raise the risk of accidental discharges. Eight major incidents left 17 dead and 9 injured (e.g., Santa Monica College, Sparks Middle School).
2014;Giffords Law Center began tracking mishandled guns in schools, documenting dropped or unattended firearms by adults. While security measures expanded, mass shootings persisted — ten incidents left 16 dead and 10 injured (including Marysville Pilchuck High School and Seattle Pacific University).
2015;Deadly shootings like Umpqua Community College (10 killed) defined the year, totaling about 25 deaths nationwide. At the same time, Giffords data began revealing how police and school staff mishandled firearms — from unsecured weapons to accidental discharges on school grounds.
2016;Reports surfaced of guns unintentionally fired by school officers and mishandled during student discipline. Calls for arming educators faced growing criticism from teachers and parents citing safety concerns.Roughly 10 people died in school shootings that year.
2017;Several tragic and alarming events underscored mental health and stress-related gun misuse by school employees. Incidents involving suicides and self-inflicted gunfire on campus revealed the emotional toll of gun access. Mass shootings in San Bernardino, Aztec, and Rockford left around 15 people dead.
2018;A year marked by high-profile mishandlings — including teachers firing guns in class and officers’ accidental discharges. Research and public sentiment increasingly opposed arming teachers as a safety strategy. The deadliest year since 2012, with Parkland (17 dead) and Santa Fe (10 dead) among several major incidents.
2019;Dozens of cases were reported of guns left unattended, fired accidentally, or brought onto campuses by adults. Studies confirmed that armed staff did not improve school safety outcomes. While fewer mass shootings occurred, the data showed that everyday negligence posed persistent danger in schools.
2020;Despite school closures during the pandemic, incidents continued — often involving parents, officers, and teachers mishandling firearms during school pickups or at home-related events. The decrease likely reflected limited in-person schooling rather than true improvement in gun control or behavior.
2021;As schools reopened, shootings resurged — Oxford High School (4 dead) capped a year with over a dozen fatalities. Several altercations involving firearms occurred during drop-offs and school events, reaffirming that more guns led to greater risk, not safety. This dramatic increase revealed that school gun incidents were not merely paused by the pandemic, but rather suppressed temporarily by lockdowns.
